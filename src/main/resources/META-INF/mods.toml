This mod takes famous songs in Clone Hero and creates music discs for them!

There are no added creative mode tabs or extra features - just the music discs,
and they are made to blend exactly with the game (other than a /give command because
of the modid the items are registered with). That includes creepers dropping these
custom music discs!

These songs were all added with consent of the original composer.

Visit the GitHub page to suggest a new song.
